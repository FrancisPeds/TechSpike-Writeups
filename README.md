# 📚 TechSpike-Writeups

**A collection of real-world technical spike writeups and implementation notes from enterprise software projects.**

This repository contains a series of structured, real-world inspired technical spike documents. Each write-up is a standalone markdown file describing how a particular challenge was approached, explored, and solved—typically during proof-of-concepts (PoCs), architectural explorations, or pre-implementation research phases.

The goal is to:
- Capture learnings from past implementations
- Showcase design decisions and trade-offs
- Provide reusable insights for future reference
- Reflect enterprise software development practices

## 📁 Structure

Each `.md` file is a self-contained writeup of a technical spike, such as:

```
TechSpike-Writeups/
├── README.md
├── launchdarkly-integration-journey.md
├── azure-pipeline-conditional-flows.md
├── clean-architecture-vs-feature-folders.md
├── efcore-ctes-performance.md
```

---

## ✍️ What's Included in Each Writeup

- Background / problem statement
- Constraints or blockers
- Options considered
- Final solution and rationale
- Code or architecture examples (if applicable)
- Trade-offs and future improvements

## 📄 Current Writeups

- ✅ `launchdarkly-integration-journey.md`: A breakdown of how our team adopted LaunchDarkly incrementally, starting from appsettings flags, and evolved toward multi-client feature targeting via context-aware flags.

More writeups will be added over time.
