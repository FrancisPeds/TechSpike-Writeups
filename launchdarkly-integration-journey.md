# 🔍 Tech Spike: Gradual Integration of LaunchDarkly for Feature Flag Management

## 📌 Background

As our team prepared to implement feature flags across our application, I was tasked with conducting a proof-of-concept (PoC) for feature flag integration. The long-term direction was to use **LaunchDarkly**, but due to licensing and procurement delays, we needed an interim solution that could still support initial rollout needs.

## 🚧 Phase 1: Interim AppSettings-Based Feature Flags

### ❓ Problem
At the time of the PoC, our overall technical lead was still finalizing the license for LaunchDarkly, leaving us without an official flag provider.

### ⚙️ Temporary Solution
We created a **lightweight in-app feature flag system** using `appsettings.json`. The flag-checking logic was centralized and designed with a swappable backend in mind.

**Process Flow:**
1. Feature flags were stored in `appsettings.json`.
2. Each feature toggle was read through a common service.
3. We toggled features by updating the appsettings values **through release pipeline variable overrides**.

This approach allowed us to:
- Begin adopting a feature-flag-based mindset early
- Maintain a clean separation of concerns in the codebase
- Set up the foundation for later LaunchDarkly integration

### 💡 Design Decision
Even in this early phase, we designed our feature toggle interface and DI setup to mimic what we'd eventually use with LaunchDarkly. This ensured minimal rework when the official tool became available.

## 🚀 Phase 2: LaunchDarkly Official Integration

### ✅ License Approval
About 1–2 months later, we received confirmation that LaunchDarkly would be the official provider. Our organization’s **Feature Management Team** provided a reusable internal library that abstracted flag logic for multiple vendors (including LaunchDarkly).

### 🛠️ Integration Process
We were one of the first teams to adopt this library, and as such, we worked closely with the Feature Management Team to:

- Adjust initial configurations and flag naming conventions  
- Align user context handling and targeting practices  
- Report edge cases and contribute feedback for improvements  

During this process, new sprint requirements emerged that involved **client-specific feature availability**. This introduced a need for **context-aware flag evaluation**, where a feature might only be visible to select clients using our platform.

We adapted our implementation to pass **custom client identifiers** into LaunchDarkly’s context model (via user or targeting segments), which enabled:

- Controlled rollout of features by tenant/client
- Use of targeting rules in LaunchDarkly's dashboard
- Better separation of production vs. beta testing audiences

This added complexity but also **highlighted the flexibility** of LaunchDarkly’s context and targeting system.

## 📈 Key Takeaways

- Building a **vendor-agnostic feature toggle interface** early on paid off
- Using `appsettings.json` as a stopgap is a practical pattern when evaluating tools or waiting on licenses
- Collaborating with platform or enablement teams (e.g., Feature Management) is crucial when adopting shared libraries
- Context-aware flag targeting opens the door for controlled, client-specific rollouts in multi-tenant environments

---

## 🔍 Future Considerations

- Evaluate % rollout and targeting strategies using LaunchDarkly’s advanced capabilities
- Implement dashboard visibility for non-technical product owners
- Add monitoring for flag usage and potential tech debt from stale toggles
